# puppet-sshd

This puppet module manages OpenSSH configuration and services.

**!! Upgrade Notice (01/2013) !!**

This module now uses parameterized classes, where it used global variables
before. So please whatch out before pulling, you need to change the
class declarations in your manifest !


### Dependencies

This module requires puppet => 2.6, and the following modules are required
pre-dependencies:

- shared-common: `git://labs.riseup.net/shared-common`
- shared-lsb: `git://labs.riseup.net/shared-lsb`

## OpenSSH Server

On a node where you wish to have an openssh server installed, you should
include

```puppet
class { 'sshd': }
```

on that node. If you need to configure any aspects of
sshd_config, set the variables before the include. See Configurable Variables
below for what you can set.

### Nagios

To have nagios checks setup automatically for sshd services, simply set
`manage_nagios` to `true` for that class. If you want to disable ssh
nagios checking for a particular node (such as when ssh is firewalled), then you
can set the class parameter `nagios_check_ssh` to `false` and that node will not be
monitored.

Nagios will automatically check the ports defined in `ports`, and the
hostname specified by `nagios_check_ssh_hostname`.

NOTE: this requires that you are using the shared-nagios puppet module which
supports the nagios native types via `nagios::service`:
git://labs.riseup.net/shared-nagios

### Firewall

If you wish to have firewall rules setup automatically for you, using shorewall,
you will need to set: `use_shorewall => true`. The `ports` that you have
specified will automatically be used.

NOTE: This requires that you are using the shared-shorewall puppet module:
git://labs.riseup.net/shared-shorewall


### Configurable variables

Configuration of sshd is strict, and may not fit all needs, however there are a
number of variables that you can consider configuring. The defaults are set to
the distribution shipped sshd_config file defaults.

To set any of these variables, simply set them as variables in your manifests,
before the class is included, for example:

```puppet
class {'sshd':
  listen_address => ['10.0.0.1', '192.168.0.1'],
  use_pam        => yes
}
```

If you need to install a version of the ssh daemon or client package other than
the default one that would be installed by `ensure => installed`, then you can
set the following variables:

```puppet
class {'sshd':
  ensure_version => "1:5.2p2-6"
}
```

The following is a list of the currently available variables:

  - `listen_address`
        specify the addresses sshd should listen on set this to `['10.0.0.1', '192.168.0.1']` to have it listen on both addresses, or leave it unset to listen on all Default: empty -> results in listening on `0.0.0.0`

  - `allowed_users`
    list of usernames separated by spaces.  set this for example to `"foobar
    root"` to ensure that only user foobar and root might login.  Default: empty
    -> no restriction is set

  - `allowed_groups`
    list of groups separated by spaces. set this for example to `"wheel sftponly"`
    to ensure that only users in the groups wheel and sftponly might login.
    Default: empty -> no restriction is set Note: This is set after
    `allowed_users`, take care of the behaviour if you use these 2 options
    together.

  - `use_pam` if you want to use pam or not for authenticaton. Values:

    `yes` or `no`; Default: `no`

  - `kerberos_orlocalpasswd`
    If password authentication through Kerberos fails, then the password will be
    validated via any additional local mechanism.  Valid values: `yes` or `no`;

    s/key passowords are disabled Valid values: `yes` or `no`; Default: `no`

  - `head_additional_options`
    Set this to any additional sshd_options which aren't listed above. Anything

  - `tail_additional_options`

    Set this to any additional sshd_options which aren't listed above. Anything

### Defines and functions

Deploy authorized_keys file with the define `authorized_key`.

Generate a public/private keypair with the ssh_keygen function. For example, the
following will generate ssh keys and put the different parts of the key into
variables:

```puppet
$ssh_keys = ssh_keygen("${$ssh_key_basepath}/backup/keys/${::fqdn}/${backup_host}")
$public_key = split($ssh_keys[1],' ')
$sshkey_type => $public_key[0]
$sshkey => $public_key[1]
```

## Client


On a node where you wish to have the ssh client managed, you can do:

```puppet
class{'sshd::client':

}
```

in the node definition. This will install the appropriate package.
